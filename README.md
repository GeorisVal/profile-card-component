## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Better usage of Flexbox, positioning of images, preview of responsive using positioning alone. 
Pushed forward into the Semantics HTML.

Some of the tags:
```html
<main></main>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
```

### Continued development

Continuing to look into Semantics HTML, managing classes/IDs.

__Next focus__: merging margins/paddings in order to clean my CSS code
